This little program, takes the numbers within a text file and finds the sum, average, and product
The program then outputs the results back into the same textfile
To make the program work, just drag the .cpp file and "numbers.txt" to the same location.
You can edit and change the numbers within the file.
I hope this helps anyone's understand of how to do this.
